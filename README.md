# Blindwrite Clone

Try it out [here](https://financial-stability.github.io/Blindwrite-Clone/)!

Clone of [BlindWrite](https://blindwrite.herokuapp.com/) (link no longer available).
A space to jot down thoughts, but blurring what you've already written to hopefully stop yourself from constantly self-editing.
Set a topic, start a timer, write with this app.

## Instructions
* Set a topic
* Set a timer
* Write until timer ends and text is unblurred
* Click "Blindwrite" to blur text again if you would like to continue writing.
* Click "Write" to unblur text

## Preview
**Writing about Chosen Topic. Bar at the top represents a timer, upon completion text is unblurred.**
