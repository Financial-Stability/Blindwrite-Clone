# Blindwrite Clone

Try it out [here](https://financial-stability.github.io/Blindwrite-Clone/)!

Clone of [BlindWrite](https://blindwrite.herokuapp.com/) (original app no longer available).
A space to jot down thoughts, but blurring what you've already written to (hopefully) stop yourself from constantly self-editing.
Set a topic, start a timer, write with this app.

## Instructions
1. Set a topic
2. Set a timer
3. Write until timer ends and text is unblurred
4. Once timer is done:
   - Click "Blindwrite" to blur text again if you would like to continue writing.
   - Click "Write" to unblur text
   - Refresh page if you want to restart

## Preview

Writing about Chosen Topic. Bar at the top represents a timer, upon completion text is unblurred. Afterwards, click the title to toggle blur.
