# Blindwrite Clone
 Clone of BlindWrite (https://blindwrite.herokuapp.com/).
 A space to jot down thoughts, but blurring what you've already written. 
 Set a topic, start a timer, write with this app.
![Writing about Chosen Topic. Bar at the top represents a timer, upon completion text is unblurred] (https://github.com/KoyaS/Blindwrite-Clone/blob/master/blindWrite.png)
